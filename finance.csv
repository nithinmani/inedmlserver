These are 3 things Yahoo Finance will be looking out for. Number one is national security: How will TikTok address privacy and data security concerns as well as how it handles user data, and what would TikTok do if the Chinese government says hand that data over? Number two is TikTok’s growth: TikTok this week revealed its monthly active users in the U.S. hit 150M; that's a jump of 50% in the past 2+ years. Any wide-ranging U.S. ban could potentially hurt the more than 100,000 creators using TikTok for extra income. Number three is influence or interference: 2024 is a presidential election year in the U.S., so expect questions on misinformation, political influence, and even how children are affected by the content.
